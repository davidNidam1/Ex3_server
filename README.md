## Introduction
Welcome to our project, Facybook! This README file serves as a guide to understanding and running our web application, Android application, and server. In this project stage, we have successfully built a server following specific APIs, enabled token generation for users, and established communication between the web application and the server. While the Android application integration is a work in progress, we have made significant strides in improving its code architecture.

## Overview
Our project, Facybook, is inspired by Facebook and aims to provide a similar social media experience across web and mobile platforms. The project consists of three main components:

1. **Server**: This component handles communication between the web application, Android application, and the database. Please note that the server code needs to be downloaded from the "develop" branch to ensure compatibility with the ongoing project development.

2. **Web Application**: A user interface accessed via a web browser, interacting with the server to fetch and display data. The web application code can be found in the [Ex2_Web](https://github.com/davidNidam1/Ex2_Web.git) repository.

3. **Android Application**: A mobile interface, currently undergoing improvements in its code architecture. The Android application code can be found in the [Ex2_Android](https://github.com/davidNidam1/Ex2_Android.git) repository.

# Running the System
To run the system locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up MongoDB
- Download MongoDB from the official website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
- Once installed, start the MongoDB server by running the `mongod` command in your terminal or command prompt.
- Press "Connect" to ensure successful connection to the MongoDB database.

### 2. Run the Server
- Download the server code from the "develop" branch of our repository.
- Open the server code in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- Press `F5` or run the server using the appropriate command to start the server.

### 3. Launch the Web Application
- Download the web application code from the main branch of our repository.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the web application code.
- Run the command `npm start` to start the development server for the web application.
- Make sure that no other application is running on port `3000` to avoid conflicts.

### 4. Explore the Android Application
- Download the Android application code from the main branch of our repository to explore the improvements made in its code architecture.
- Follow the installation instructions provided for your specific Android device or emulator.

## Conclusion
With the server successfully built and the web application connected, our project, Facybook, is well underway. Although the Android application integration remains a work in progress, significant improvements have been made to its code architecture. We hope you enjoy exploring our project and welcome any feedback or contributions.
